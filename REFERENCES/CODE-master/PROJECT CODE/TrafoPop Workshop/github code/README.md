Additional required tool for editing, compiling and uploading the code to the Arduino:

If you connect your Arduino device to your computer you should see two additional serial ports in the Tools menu of the Arduino software.
If not please install the USB FTDI driver for the Arduino Nano from the FTDI website:
http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm

In the Arduino Software in the Tools menu select your Board: Arduino Nano w/ ATmega328
And select the serial port: /dev/tty.usbserialâ€¦ (on Mac)
